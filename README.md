# Consensys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2021

Final project for Consensys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2021.

## Description

A NFT explorer to see NFTs that an address owns.

## Why?

Some platforms are a bit complicated to see NFTs that an adresses own, so I'd like to create something simple and right to the point.

## Worflow

1. User search for an address.
2. The Dapp searches for which NFTs that address own.
3. It shows the metadata related for that NFT (if any).
4. Also it shows details about the NFT.
